Using branches is a powerful and safe way for a team of software engineers to collaborate on
a single project because it allows for the separation of new features. Branches let the team 
create copies of the main repository without affecting it. This is especially helpful in
preventing accidental overwrites or deletions of the main codebase. Additionally, features
can be easily modified or removed as needed.
